In Python list comprehensions, the first part (before the `for` keyword) is typically an **expression**, which determines the elements that will be added to the list. However, other things can be there, depending on how you define "other than an expression." Let's explore what can go in that place:

### 1. **Expressions**
   - Any Python expression that evaluates to a value can be used. Examples:
     - Arithmetic: `x**2`
     - String manipulation: `str(x)`
     - Function calls: `some_function(x)`
     - Conditional expressions: `x if x % 2 == 0 else -x`

### 2. **Tuples**
   - You can create tuples in that position:
     ```python
     [(x, x**2) for x in range(1, 11)]
     ```

### 3. **Literal Values**
   - Fixed values or constants can also be used:
     ```python
     [42 for x in range(1, 11)]
     ```

### 4. **Method Calls**
   - Methods can be applied to `x` or other objects:
     ```python
     [str(x).upper() for x in range(1, 11)]
     ```

### 5. **Nested List Comprehensions**
   - Entire list comprehensions can appear here:
     ```python
     [[y for y in range(x)] for x in range(1, 5)]
     ```

### 6. **Generator Expressions**
   - Although uncommon in practice, generator expressions can also fit here:
     ```python
     [sum(y for y in range(x)) for x in range(1, 5)]
     ```

### 7. **Anonymous Functions (Lambdas)**
   - Lambdas can be used if needed:
     ```python
     [(lambda y: y**2)(x) for x in range(1, 11)]
     ```

### 8. **Formatted Strings**
   - You can use f-strings:
     ```python
     [f"Square of {x} is {x**2}" for x in range(1, 11)]
     ```

### 9. **Objects or Class Instances**
   - If you have custom classes, you can instantiate them:
     ```python
     [MyClass(x) for x in range(1, 11)]
     ```

### Conclusion
While the most common use case is expressions like `x**2`, Python list comprehensions are highly flexible, and you can include almost anything that produces or transforms data in that first position. The key is that it must evaluate to a value that can be added to the resulting list.
