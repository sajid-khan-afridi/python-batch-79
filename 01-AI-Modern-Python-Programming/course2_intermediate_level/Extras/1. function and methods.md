### **Functions**
A **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task and is not tied to any specific object. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can be called independently. They work with various types of data, as long as the data is compatible with the function.

#### **Example of a Function**
```python
# A simple function
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Sikandar"))  # Output: Hello, Sikandar!
```

#### **Characteristics of Functions**
1. **Standalone**: Functions exist independently and are not bound to any object.
2. **Input & Output**: Functions can take arguments as input and return values as output.
3. **Global Scope**: Functions can be used anywhere in the script or module where they are defined or imported.

### **Methods**

**method** is similar to a function but is always associated with an **object**. Methods operate on the data contained in the object they belong to. They are defined as part of a class and can only be called on instances of that class. The first parameter of a method is usually `self`, which refers to the specific instance of the class.

#### **Example of a Method**

```python
# A class with a method
class Greeter:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Creating an object
g = Greeter()
print(g.greet("Sikandar"))  # Output: Hello, Sikandar!
```

#### **Characteristics of Methods**

1. **Tied to Objects**: Methods are always associated with an object (e.g., a list, string, or custom class).
2. **Implicit `self`**: The object instance is automatically passed as the first argument (`self`), enabling methods to operate on the specific instance.
3. **Specific Context**: Methods work in the context of the object they belong to and can access or modify the object's attributes.

### **Key Differences Between Functions and Methods**

| Feature            | Function                            | Method                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Defined independently using `def`.  | Defined within a class.                                   |
| **Invocation**     | Called directly: `function_name()`. | Called on an object: `object.method()`.                   |
| **Binding**        | Not tied to any object.             | Tied to a specific object.                                |
| **First Argument** | No implicit argument.               | Takes the object instance (`self`) as the first argument. |
| **Example**        | `len(list)`                         | `list.append('item')`                                     |

### **Combined Example**

```python
# Function
def calculate_square(number):
    return number ** 2

print(calculate_square(5))  # Output: 25 (Function)

# Method
class Calculator:
    def calculate_square(self, number):
        return number ** 2

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.calculate_square(5))  # Output: 25 (Method)
```
