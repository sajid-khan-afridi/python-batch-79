The symbols `!`, `%`, `%%`, `??`, and `?` are **primarily used in interactive Python environments** like:

- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **JupyterLab**
- **Google Colab**
- **IPython shell**

### Your Table (with Notes)

| Symbol | Name/Type    | Use / Description                                     | Example                    | Available In            |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `!`    | Shell Escape | Run shell/system commands                             | `!pwd`, `!pip install ...` | Jupyter, Colab, IPython |
| `%`    | Line Magic   | Run magic command for one line                        | `%timeit ...`              | Jupyter, Colab, IPython |
| `%%`   | Cell Magic   | Run magic command for the whole cell                  | `%%writefile ...`          | Jupyter, Colab, IPython |
| `?`    | Help/Info    | Show basic help/documentation for object or command   | `sum?`                     | Jupyter, Colab, IPython |
| `??`   | Help/Source  | Show extended help, including source code if possible | `sum??`                    | Jupyter, Colab, IPython |

#### **More Info**

- All these features work the same in **Google Colab**, **JupyterLab**, and **classic Jupyter Notebook**.
- They are made available by the **IPython kernel**(IPython stands for "Interactive Python"), which powers these environments.
- **IPython** is an interactive command-line tool for Python.
  It lets you write and run Python code more easily, with features like auto-completion, easy access to help, running system commands, and special shortcuts (magics).
  It is the core technology behind Jupyter and Colab notebooks.
- Some **line/cell magics** are specific to IPython and may not be available in other Python IDEs (like PyCharm or VS Code terminals) unless running an IPython shell.

**Summary:**

- Your table is correct for Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook/Lab, and any IPython-based environment.
- They are not part of standard Python, but are a feature of these interactive, notebook-style environments.
